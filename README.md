# Angular2 Foundation

A Selection of [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) components made with [Angular 2](https://angular.io) (rc-1). The components can be found in the app/foundation folder.

Just playing around with Angular 2 - I only needed the Tabs and Accordion, and just threw a few others in...the most simple ones :-) There will be different (better) ways to go about building these components, and certainly a more consistent approach. Things can/will break with subsequent releases.

The build/config taken directly from the official [5 minute quickstart](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html).
