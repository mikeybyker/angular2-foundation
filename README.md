# Angular2 Foundation

A few [Angular 2](https://angular.io) (version 2.1.0) [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) components.

An exercise in following alpha and beta Angular2 releases - updates made as the release cycle progressed until the full 2.0.0 release. These are trivial experiments and not something to be used in production! There will be different (better) ways to go about building these components and certainly a more consistent approach. The switches propagate changes to the Model and DOM, so if any are useful, it'll be them.

The build/config taken directly from the official [5 minute quickstart](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html).
